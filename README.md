## Why am I here?
Hello visitor, I am [Recap](https://github.com/recap48), I am just a random developer. You probably ended up here because you wanted the `git.new/golang` short link that I have now.

I have no intension in keeping them to myself, I was just checking how many shortlinks I can get before it becomes too popular. I intent to giveaway most of them. If you think you are a good fit for the short link then email me at `freakrecap@gmail.com` with your price. I will be happy to transfer it If I have no use of it.
